[0.6] 12-3-2012
  * Added support for ruby and python
  * Made thrift configs watched sources so they will be automatically
	compiled with changes when ~ is used
  * Added file cache to files won't be compiled when there aren't
	changes. ( this isn't really working though )
  * Changed org name from 'atd' to 'com.github.bigtoast'
  * Upped to sbt 0.12

[0.4] 11.18.2011
 * Merged in pull request from rssh. This adds javascript generation and
	refactors the compile thrift into a method.

[0.3] 10.27.2011
 * Changed the thrift command to use ! rather than Process(cmd).run()
	because it looks like Process run will run the process in a
	different thread. This was causing some java files not to be
	compiled in the first call to compile.
	
[0.2] 10.26.2011
 * Initial release
